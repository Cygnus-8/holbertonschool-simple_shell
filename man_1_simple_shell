.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.R [\fR \fIfilename\fR]\fR or \fR[\fI command\fI and \fI their \fI Options\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
\fR is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
.PP
.PP
.B Invocation :

.PP
.in +2
\fBhsh\fR can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
If \fBhsh\fR is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

If \fBhsh\fR is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (as determined by \fIisatty(3)\fR), an \fIinteractive\fR shell is opened.
When executing interactively, \fBhsh\fR displays the prompt \fI$\fR when it is ready to read a command.
.PP
.in +2
Alternatively, if command line arguments are supplied on the call, \fBhsh\fR treats the first argument as an executable file from which
to read commands. The file provided must contain one command per line. \fBhsh\fR executes each of the commands in the file in order before terminating.

.PP

.B Environment :
.PP
.in +2
When called, \fBhsh\fR receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was executed. This environment is an array
of strings of type \fIname-value\fR describing variables in the format \fINAME=VALUE\fR.
.PP


.B Command Execution :
.PP
.in +2
After receiving a command, \fBhsh\fR tokenizes it into words using " " and \\n as a delimiter.
The first word is considered as command and all remaining words are considered as arguments to that command.
\fBhsh\fR then proceeds with the following actions :
.PP

.RS
1. If the first character of the command is neither a slash (\fI\\\fR)\fR nor dot (\fI.\fR),\fR the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.
If there exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
.RE
.PP
.RS
2. If the first character of the command is none of a slash (\fI\\\fR),\fR dot (\fI.\fR),\fR nor builtin, \fBhsh\fR searches each element of the
\fBPATH\fR environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
.RE
.PP
.RS
3. If the first character of the command is a slash (\fI\\\fR)\fR or dot (\fI.\fR)\fR or either of the above searches was successful,
the shell executes the named program with any remaining arguments given in a separate execution environment.
.RE
.PP

.B Signals :
.PP
.in +2
While running in interactive mode, \fBhsh\fR ignores the keyboard input \fBCtrl+c\fR.
Alternatively, an input of end-of-file (\fBCtrl+d\fR)\fR will exit the program.
